Book conversion steps:
- Download raw text from guthenberg.org
- Remove guthenberg header and footer
- Set first line to "TITLE by AUTHOR"
- Set last line to "<page>THE END"
- Search for multiple consecutive spaces as that usually requires custom formatting
- Remove any foot notes, author's notes, transcription notes etc. Search for []{}<>
- Replace non renderable characters including:
	— to --
	‘ to '
	’ to '
	“ to "
	” to "
	_ delete
	* custom formatting
- Replace all "\r\n\r\n" with "###"
- Replace all "\r\n" with " "
- Replace all "### " with "\r\n\r\n"
- Replace all "###" with "\r\n\r\n"
- Remove any non-narrative sections at start or end, such as biography or author or glossary
- Split into separate text documents, with 0 being the title and author and 1+ being separate chapters or section breaks, splitting the book into reasonable text lengths for UI rendering
