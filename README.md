# Nokia eReader

**What if the Nokia 3310 had included a book eReader?**

## About
This project was created in a few days for [Nokia Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam3) and can be played [here](https://rhythmlynx.itch.io/nokia-jam-3). The goal was to make something matching the restrictions of the old indestructible Nokia 3310 phone. The main constraints were the two color palette and the 84x48 resolution.

The Nokia 3310 phone was actually my first ever phone and my introduction to texting. The font and menus are the most nostalgic elements for me, so I decided to make something that focused on those.
